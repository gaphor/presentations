# Large GUI application with Python and GTK
## GUADEC 2021
Author: Arjan Molenaar 

## Abstract

Most applications written in Python remain relatively small. But what happens if your application grows? How can you grow the code base of a dynamically typed language?

We'll have a look at Gaphor, a modeling tool written in Python, and see what patterns have been used to keep the code maintainable and extensible.

## Talk Description

This session is mostly about design and architecture. At what points did we take advantage of GTK, and it's GObject, and when did we use native Python solutions. Patterns used include a service oriented architecture, and generic methods. We've added type hints to allow te IDE to be of better assistance.

## Pronouns
