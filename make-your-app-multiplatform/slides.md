# Make Your Application Multi-Platform!

Notes:

Hi I'm Arjan Molenaar and I am a software engineer working for Xebia in The
Netherlands. I've been involved in numerous projects ranging from financial
systems to embedded applications. I'm a long time GNOME user and core
contributor to a modeling tool called Gaphor.

Hi my name is Dan Yeaw. I work for Ford Motor Company in Michigan where I help
design safety in to complex software-based automated and electrified
technologies. In my free time, I have been working on an open source tool used
to model these complex system designs. That's how I got involved in contributing
with Arjan on Gaphor.
