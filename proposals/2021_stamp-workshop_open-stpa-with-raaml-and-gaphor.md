# Speaker Profile

## Name
Dan Yeaw and Kyle Post

## Biography
Dan Yeaw the Manager and Technical Lead for Functional Safety in Product
Development at Ford Motor Company. He is passionate about using Python and open
source in engineering and maintainer of the Gaphor modeling tool. He is on
Twitter at @danyeaw.

Kyle Post is the Technical Leader for Systems Safety in Research & Advanced
Engineering at Ford Motor Company. He has been leading the Risk Analysis and
Assessment Modeling Language (RAAML) OMG standard.

# Title
Open STPA with RAAML and Gaphor

# Duration
We prefer a 10min time slot

# Description
Do you want the ability to easily apply STPA using modern engineering tools?
What about using a common language so that you can easily share the information
with stakeholders?

This lighting talk gives a quick overview of the STPA portions of the Risk
Analysis & Assessment Modeling Language (RAAML) and the open source modeling tool
that has implemented STPA called Gaphor. RAAML is a new standardized modeling language
from the OMG that is out for final release now. Gaphor is an open source modeling tool
written in Python. Together they create a freely available combination for
you to quickly complete STPA for your next project. 

At the end of this talk, you should be able to have a general understanding
of how you can start to use the STPA portion of RAAML to model your project using
Gaphor using the aircraft example from the STPA Handbook as an example. 

# Who and Why (Audience)

We are aiming this talk at individuals who have learned the basics of STPA, but
now want to apply it for a project. Attendees will require basic familiarity
with STPA. Experienced STPA practitioners should still benefit by learning more
about the new RAAML language and how to more efficiently conduct STPA using a
software tool.

We also hope that a subset of the audience will be interesting in helping to in
contributing suggestions for improvement to RAAML and open source contributions
to Gaphor.

# Additional Notes

We are both experienced public speakers. Dan gave a major talk at PyCon in 2019
(300+ in attendance, 5000+ views) and a smaller talk at the Linux App Summit in
2021. He is also the organizer of the Michigan Python meetup where he has given
multiple talks. Kyle gave a talk last year at the STAMP Workshop and as well as
at CTI Conferences for systems safety.
