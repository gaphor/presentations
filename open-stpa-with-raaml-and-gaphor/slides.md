Notes:

Hi my name is Dan Yeaw. I work for Ford Motor Company where I am a Manager and
Technical Lead for Functional Safety in Product Development.  In my free time,
I have been working on an open source tool used to model these complex system
designs. That's how I got involved in contributing with Gaphor. I also like to
ride bicycles!

Hi I'm Kyle Post. I also work for Ford and I'm the Technical Leader for Systems
Safety in the Research and Advanced Engineering area. I have been leading the
Risk Analysis and Assessment Modeling Language (RAAML) OMG standard.

## A Vibrant Community

We want to build an open community for systems safety

- A low barrier to join, learn, and grow ðŸ‘¥
- Diverse contributors who want to help ðŸ”¨
- We are building this community on open standards and open source software

Notes:

---

## Safety Standards

- Each industry has developed domain specific standards, most derived fom IEC 61508
- New techniques, like STPA, can improve how we do safety analysis
- However, may lack rigor without a standardized and consistent language and automation

---

## RAAML

- Precise language for systems safety
- OMG spec 1.0 beta available, final release soon 
- STPA metamodel library based on the STPA Handbook
- Facilitates exchange of info between tools and organizations

Notes:

The Risk Analysis and Assessment Language

---

## Gaphor

- An open source UML, SysML, and now RAAML modeling tool written in Python
- Fast and easy to use, while still having a full data model
- Improves rigor through consistency, helps add automation
