# Make Your Application Multi-Platform!
## Linux App Summit 2021

### Description

Many people use Windows and macOS as their OS of choice. If we want to expose
them to Open Source software, we have to bring the software to them. Some large
projects, like GIMP and Inkscape, are available on those platforms.

What does it take to make your application available on Windows and macOS? Dan
and Arjan, maintainers of Gaphor, did just this.

In this talk we dive in to what it takes to make your application available on
all major desktop platforms. Why should you bother? How can you make it happen,
and what does it bring to your project? Tune in and find out!
