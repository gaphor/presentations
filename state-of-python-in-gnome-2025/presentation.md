::: notes

Hi, I'm Dan Yeaw and I'm Arjan Molenaar, and we are sooo excited to talk to you
about Showing up for Python in GNOME!!

We have been helping to maintain PyGObject and have been GNOME Foundation members
for the last couple years.

Arjan:

Dan:
As Engineering Manager for Open Source Software at Anaconda, I lead teams
working on projects including BeeWare, PyScript, Jupyter, and fsspec. Over the
past seven years, I've been actively contributing to open source projects while
building the Michigan Python community as a leader and organizer.

We also help maintain a Python GTK app called Gaphor which is a GNOME Circle
app for doing SysML and UML modeling. I also help maintain Gvsbuild which is
a build system for GTK on Windows.

## GNOME Python

- PyGObject is the GTK and related library bindings for Python

::: notes

PyGObject is Python in GNOME. It is the successor to PyGTK that James Henstridge started in 1998 that uses gobject-introspection directly to allow you to build GNOME apps using Python. If you see the patterns in the app icons here, those deep interests that people geek out on includes drawing and art, modeling, graphing, music, genealogy, manga, classic gaming, and scientific reports.
